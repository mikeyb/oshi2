					<h3>Why another Bitcoin casino?</h3>
					<p>Having spent many years in the iGaming sector, both Nick and
						Tom have their opinions on what makes an amazing casino. So instead
						of just talking about it, they set up Oshi.</p>
		
					<h3>Who runs the casino platform?</h3>
					<p>We work with SoftSwiss, a respected and excellent platform
						provider. We have also built up a team in the UK to help support the
						business.</p>
		
					<h3>Responsible Gambling</h3>
					<p>Gambling should always be for entertainment. That's why we
						take responsible gambling very seriously and it's why we have a
						number of projects underway to help people from going 'over the
						edge'.</p>
		
					<h3>Our Gambling Licence</h3>
					<p>We have a Curaçao sub-license from SoftSwiss, our casino
						provider.</p>
					<p>You can see and read about our Gambling License.</p>
					<p>Irrespective of licenses, we have put a lot of effort into
						building trust in Oshi. In time we expect to acquire other licenses
						from other territories depending on the countries we're operating
						in.</p>
		
					<h3>Provably fair</h3>
					<p>All games on the SoftSwiss platform are provably fair. In
						summary, we have certified that winnings and losses are truly
						random.</p>
					<p>You can read about our independent testing and verification on
						our Provably Fair page.</p>
