			<h1>Provably Fair</h1>
			<p>
				By having an <a
					href="http://www.itechlabs.com.au/certificates/Softswiss/RNG_Certificate_SoftSwiss_oshi_160915.pdf">iTech
					labs test certificate</a>, it shows that we have tested all of our
				games for randomness. It means the games on Oshi are not rigged.
			</p>
			<p>Nearly all casino games rely on algorithms that have a random
				number generator, which determines whether you win or lose. These
				generators are designed to give a small house edge that varies based
				on the game.</p>
			<p>
				iTech labs explain the testing process in more detail here:<br>

			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>If you feel we're rigged..</strong><br> The reason we
				decided to get our systems thoroughly tested by iTech labs is
				because sometimes people have a run of bad luck and they feel like
				we're rigged. Sometimes losing streaks happen. If it happens you may
				feel it's unfair, however all of our games are indepently verified
				for fairness and accuracy. If you do have a problem, then please <a
					href="https://www.oshi.io/support">contact support</a> and will go
				through your case thoroughly.
