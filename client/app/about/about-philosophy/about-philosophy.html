			<h1>Oshi Philosophy</h1>
			<h3>
				Oshi is driven by a single mission: provide an <b>advanced
					gambling experience</b>.
			</h3>

			<b>How do we plan to do that?</b>

			<h4>Being transparent</h4>
			This hasn’t always been the case in other bitcoin casinos, but we’re
			committed to being transparent about everything we do. This is why
			you can see who the founders are here, and get easily in touch with
			us through email or communities like reddit and bitcointalk.

			<h4>Being straightforward</h4>
			All the information will be presented in a simple way, no fine print
			or hidden info. Our blog will be constantly updated with news and
			what’s happening at oshi!.

			<h4>Being innovative</h4>
			Our team has been in the iGaming sector for a long time now, and
			everyone here is a huge bitcoin advocate. We genuinely believe that
			there’s a lot that can be done to improve the bitcoin casino
			experience and make it amazing, we’ll take the experimental route to
			get there.

			<h4>Being accessible</h4>
			We want to build the best casino possible, so we want to hear from
			you. We want to make it easier for you to talk to us, to ask us
			anything or give us feedback.

			<h4>Constantly learning</h4>
			We always want to be on top of all the possibilities that Bitcoin
			opens up, and we want to improve oshi! learning with other
			industries. We’re looking at what the biggest gaming, entertainment
			and ecommerce websites are doing to know how you can have a better
			experience and more fun at oshi!.
