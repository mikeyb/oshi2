      <h1>Oshi missions</h1>
 <h3> Un-LasVegas</h3>
<p>How about just getting on with being a great casino… We've deliberately toned down the 'attention grabbing', 'noise' and 'bling' so we can be judged on what really matters: playing the casino games you love. </p> 


      <h3> Make casino games the star! </h3>
      <p> We want to get out of your way... You're here because of the casino games and were here to help you.</p>
      <p>So, our job is to make playing casino games easier for you, so you can navigate, sort and find what you want...fast. </p>
      <h3>Be loved & trusted by our customers</h3>
      <h3>How do we plan to do that?</h3>
      <h4>Be transparent</h4>
      This hasn’t always been the case in other bitcoin casinos, but we’re committed to being transparent about everything we do. This is why you can see who the founders are here, and get easily in touch with us through email or communities like reddit and bitcointalk.
      <h4>Being straightforward</h4>
      All the information will be presented in a simple way, no fine print or hidden info. Our blog will be constantly updated with news and what’s happening at Oshi.
      <h4>Being innovative</h4>
      Our team has been in the iGaming sector for a long time now, and everyone here is a huge bitcoin advocate. We genuinely believe that there’s a lot that can be done to improve the bitcoin casino experience and make it amazing, so we’ll take the experimental route to get there.
      <h4>Being accessible</h4>
      We want to build the best casino possible, so we want to hear from you. We want to make it easier for you to talk to us, to ask us anything or give us feedback.
      <h4>Constantly learning</h4>
      We always want to be on top of all the possibilities that Bitcoin opens up, and we want to improve Oshi learning with other industries. We’re looking at what the biggest gaming, entertainment and ecommerce websites are doing to know how you can have a better experience and more fun at Oshi. </div>
