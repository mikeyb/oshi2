					from Nick Garner, CEO Oshi. </b><br> <br> Our number one
				priority is to have a long-term, positive relationship with you.<br>
				<br> It's down to us to be fair, helpful and fun to be around.
				For you, all we ask is your sensible with your gambling and always
				play within your means. <br> <br> Everyone knows that
				addiction can take over your whole life and ruin it. So be the smart
				one and always watch your gameplay to see if you can stop at any
				time. If you can't then maybe something is wrong. <br> <br>
				<b>What's in it for us. </b><br> <br> In case no one ever
				talked to you about this, let me explain how addiction works from a
				commercial point of view for operators. Essentially in my experience
				operators have a love/fear relationship with gambling addicts. <br>
				<br> The 'love' is that they get large revenues from people who
				can't control themselves because they are addicted. <br> <br>
				The 'fear' is that if they behave in a reckless manner, unreasonably
				encouraging addiction, they will be at risk of losing their gambling
				licences and their reputations as good operators. <br> <br>
				Of course, there are some operators who are ruthless and won't stop
				at anything to rinse you of every penny you have. <br> Casino

				<br> Gambling grumbles has also got some useful advisories <a

				<br> <br> Commercially, our position is simple: your
				lifetime value with us is greatest if we have a sustainable and
				positive relationship with you. <br> <br> This means means
				we spend less marketing money per active player, which in turn means
				we can spend more on customer services, site development and general
				customer experience, which then means were more likely to be
				recommended and in turn we get more customers. <br> <br>
				It's a funny thing... When you put customers first, good things
				happen. <br> <br> <b>Dealing with addiction </b><br>
				<br> The first question is: are you addicted? That's always a
				difficult question if you are actually addicted to gambling, because
				how do you know. If you're not sure, then take this quick anonymous
				psychology test and see what the results come back with. Remember,
				unless you look at yourself objectively, it's very hard to work out
				whether you have an addiction or not. <br>

				</ul> If you are addicted to gambling, the first thing is to get some
				help and break the addiction. <br> <br> <b>Help: </b><br>

				</ul> <b>What's Oshi doing? </b><br> <br> We only accept
				customers who are over 18. If you know someone who is under 18 and
				gambling on or website, please let us know immediately and we will
				close their account. Email us on contact@oshi.io <br> <br>
				We constantly monitor player activity and look for abnormal patterns
				which can give us an indication that something is potentially wrong
				and that somebody is spending more than they can afford. <br> <br>
				Sometimes its difficult to make the right judgement call before
				reaching out to somebody because it's hard to assess what financial
				means a customer might have. But as a general rule, we will always
				initially reach out by email if we have a concern for your welfare.
				<br> <br> Because we want to be friends with you on an
				ongoing basis, we have a number of projects in the pipeline which we
				will talk about and ask for your feedback on in our blog: <a
				href="http://blog.oshi.io/">http://blog.oshi.io</a> <br> <br>
				With all these responsible gambling projects were working on, our
				main philosophy is to help you have fun gambling within your means.
				<br> <br> If you have any complaints or issues about our
				conduct around responsible gambling, then please email me directly
				because I want to hear about this: nick.garner@oshi.io <br> <br>
				Thanks <br> <br> Nick <br> CEO Oshi</font>
