			<p>The Company is only accepting players who are

				attempts of minors to register and play at our
				casino. The casino reserves the right to ask for proof
				of identity and in case the player has not reached the
				legal age to play, access to the website will
				be denied. However, we realize that due
				to a wide availability of Internet people under age
				still have a chance to register and play
				at an online casino. We therefore strongly encourage
				parents to cooperate in protecting their children from
				free access to gaming websites. There is special software
				that can help in this matter. Please visit the following
				websites for more information.</p>
