			<h1>TOR</h1>

			<p>oshi! Casino is currently not on the Tor network, but that
				doesn't mean you can't use Tor Browser with our services! You can
				even keep yourself fairly secure! We respect you and your privacy,
				always! You can leave the Tor Browser's Privacy Settings all set,
				and only have to drop the Security Level slider down to Medium-High
				for maximum compatibility (We use HTML5).</p>
