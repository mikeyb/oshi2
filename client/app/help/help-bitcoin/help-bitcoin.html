			<h1>Bitcoin guide</h1>
			<p>We don't claim to be the experts on Bitcoin, so we've done our
				best to find other sources of information which we know are
				trustworthy.</p>
			<p>Anyhow, if you're new to Bitcoin then here's some useful
				information to get you on your way.</p>
			<h2>Why use Bitcoins?</h2>
			<p>
				The completely unscientific lazy view: <br> A very good reason
				is because other people are using Bitcoin... Transaction volumes are
				going up and the price of Bitcoin has remained stable for a long
				time (as of writing this on 25 September 2015)
			</p>
			<p>
				This chart shows you transaction volumes over time. Live chart here:

			</p>
			<p>This chart shows you price over time, what we like is how
				stable the prices been recently. That's good, because at least you
				know your moneys value will be stable.</p>
			<p>

					href="https://blockchain.info/charts/market-price?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address="><img

					width="600" border="0"></a>
			</p>
			<p>
				You notice the huge spike in prices...?, that was the Bitcoin
				bubble. In those bad days, people just jumped into it for the same
				reason they bought <a
					href="http://www.thebubblebubble.com/historic-crashes/">tulips,
					railway stocks and real estate in Florida in the 1920's </a>(speculation/profit).
				Our view: Bitcoin is turning from a means of speculation, to an
				everyday utility.
			</p>
			<p>If all these millions of other people use Bitcoin and are
				happy with it, there must be something good going on.</p>
			<p>And the Internet needs its own 'cash' system for making fast,
				cheap, secure transactions anywhere, irrespective of what country
				you're in.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Other more 'sensible' reasons: </strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Transactions are fast - on average 8 minutes. <br> That means
				money in and out of your gambling account literally within minutes.
				Compare that to traditional funding methods through the banking
				system, which will take you from two days up to a week, depending on
				where you are in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's a very useful resource on Bitcoin transactions:<a
					href="https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time">blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time</a>,
				it shows the median reconciliation times for fee paying transactions
				at around eight minutes - fast transactions...

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cheap transactions - typically $0.02 USD / 2 Cents
					USD</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Bitcoin transfers are really cheap. To send money to someone,
				it costs around $0.02 - yes two cents USD</p>
			<p>
				This site predicts the transaction fees expected for Bitcoin, so
				it's a useful frame of reference if you're concerned about
				transaction costs<br> <a href="http://www.cointape.com/#delay">cointape.com/#delay</a>

			<p>Whats the benefit to you? Well, you can move money in an out
				of your Oshi Bitcoin account for virtually nothing. It's helpful if
				you're one of those 'win and cash out' types.</p>
			<p>
				Secure and (Sort of) anonymous<br> Bitcoin is a
				pseudo-anonymous means of transaction. It's a bit like an author
				writing under a pseudonym. If that author's pseudonym is ever linked
				to their true identity, everything ever written by them will now be
				linked to that author. With Bitcoin, your pseudonym is the address
				to which you receive Bitcoin. Every transaction that was ever done
				is stored in something called the block chain. So if you're address
				is ever linked to your identity, every single transaction you've
				ever done will be linked to you...<br> These articles explain
				it very well:

				sensible and legal...</p>

				<strong>Overview</strong><br> Put simply, you can think of
				Bitcoin as cash for the Internet. So, a bit like like cash,
				transacting in Bitcoin is fast, free/nearly free and its
				semi-anonymous.
			</p>
			<p>
				This article puts the argument for Bitcoin very nicely: <a
					href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/why-use-bitcoin/">coindesk.com/information/why-use-bitcoin/</a>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A great starter reference is: <a
					href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-for-individuals">bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-for-individuals</a>
				</li>
				<li>This wiki is more comprehensive: <a
					href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Help:FAQ">en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Help:FAQ</a></li>
				<li>And of course Wikipedia:<a
					href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">
						en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To get some Bitcoins, it begins with a wallet (this is a
				computer program which stores your Bitcoins, it's a little like a
				program for storing passwords) :</p>
			<p>Just like having cash, you need a wallet to put it in. In this
				case you will need a virtual wallet that is in your mobile phone
				and/or on your hard drive somewhere.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Wallets</strong><br> Bitcoin.org have a useful list of
				wallets: <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet</a>
			</p>
			<p>You can have wallets either on your mobile phone, desktop or
				on a cloud:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mobile: <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet</a>
					- click on the mobile tab...
				</li>
				<li>Android: Google play: <a
					href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=bitcoin%20wallet&c=apps&hl=en_GB">play.google.com/store/search?q=bitcoin%20wallet</a></li>
				<li>iPhone: <a
					href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/bitwallet-bitcoin-wallet/id777634714?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo=4">itunes.apple.com/app/bitwallet-bitcoin-wallet/id777634714</a>
					| <a
					href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/blockchain-bitcoin-wallet/id493253309?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">itunes.apple.com/app/blockchain-bitcoin-wallet/id493253309</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>And of course there are loads more mobile wallets out there...
				so take your pick</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Desktop wallet: </strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Bitcoin.org has a really useful reference: <a
					href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet</a>
				- click the desktop tab
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cloud wallets</strong><br> The downside is you're
				trusting somebody else with your Bitcoins... But they are very
				convenient, because you can access your Bitcoins from anywhere
			</p>
			<p>My advice is to have different stashes of Bitcoins in
				different places and move the money around as you wish. It's a bit
				like keeping some of your cash somewhere in your house (desktop
				wallet), in your pocket (mobile wallet ) and in your bank account
				(cloud wallet).</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Be sensible!</strong><br> Just like carrying a wad of
				cash around, you should also take some precautions with your Bitcoin
				wallet<br> <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know">bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Buying and selling Bitcoins. </strong>
			</p>
			<p>Just like changing currency, you change your local country's
				money into Bitcoin. A parallel for changing money into Bitcoin,
				would be changing a local currency into United States dollars, which
				can then be transacted more or less globally.</p>
			<p>Here's a list of the currencies you can exchange into Bitcoin
				(as of 25 September 2015)</p>
			<p>
				ARS Argentina Peso<br> AUD Australia Dollar<br> BGN
				Bulgaria Lev<br> BRL Brazil Real<br> CAD Canada Dollar<br>
				CHF Switzerland Franc<br> CLP Chile Peso<br> CNY China
				Yuan Renminbi<br> CZK Czech Republic Koruna<br> DKK
				Denmark Krone<br> EUR Euro Member Countries<br> GBP United
				Kingdom Pound<br> HKD Hong Kong Dollar<br> HRK Croatia
				Kuna<br> HUF Hungary Forint<br> IDR Indonesia Rupiah<br>
				ILS Israel Shekel<br> INR India Rupee<br> JPY Japan Yen<br>
				KES Kenya Shilling<br> MXN Mexico Peso<br> MYR Malaysia
				Ringgit<br> NOK Norway Krone<br> NGN Nigeria Naira<br>
				NZD New Zealand Dollar<br> PHP Philippines Peso<br> PKR
				Pakistan Rupee<br> PLN Poland Zloty<br> RUB/RUR Russia
				Ruble<br> RSD Serbia Dinar<br> SEK Sweden Krona<br>
				SGD Singapore Dollar<br> THB Thailand Baht<br> TRY Turkey
				Lira<br> UAH Ukraine Hryvnia<br> USD United States Dollar<br>
				VEF Venezuela Bolivar<br> ZAR South Africa Rand

			<p>Where to find a good exchange</p>
			<ul>
				<li>This site lists hundreds of exchanges. You can sort the
					exchanges by currency: <a href="http://howtobuybitcoins.info">howtobuybitcoins.info</a>
				</li>
				<li>And another good resource for exchanges: <a
					href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trading_bitcoins">en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trading_bitcoins</a></li>
				<li>And this <a
					href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comparison_of_real-time_trading_exchanges">en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comparison_of_real-time_trading_exchanges</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each exchange will have its own process you have to go through
				to buy Bitcoins. It's reasonable to say the most popular exchanges
				will probably have the best user experience.</p>
			<p>
				Also, different exchanges have different exchange rates and
				identity/know your customer procedures. The best thing is to hang
				out on the forums and see what others say to work out who is best
				for you: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">https://bitcointalk.org/</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you've bought your Bitcoins, it's time to use them... <br>
				<br> And a great place to start is on our website ;-) <br>
